Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of a C++ compiler, 
the cmake build system, and the sdsl library.

For Linux, you can install these libraries via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 32-bit integers. 
   
   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 64-bit integers. This requires double the amount of memory.
   
After compilation the binary `plcp' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./plcp -h
